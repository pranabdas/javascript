### Tools for Javascript development 

In order to run Javascript all you need any modern browser, and a text editor to write your codes. I am using Visual Studio Code text editor and Safari browser. You can pick any of your choice. 

Just load an empty <a href="https://github.com/pranabdas/js-learning/" target="_blank">index.html</a> file in your browser. Click anywhere on the viewport, and choose Inspect element. There you will find a browser console. That's where we will be working. We can also link a `script.js` file and write our javascript on a separate file. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
    <title>Empty page for Javascript development. </title>
</head> 

<body>
</body>

<script src="script.js"></script>
</html>
```
