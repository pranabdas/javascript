### Project: shopping cart

Purpose is to explore react. Let us install Bootstrap as well.
```js
npm i bootstrap
```

In the above `i` stands for `install`. In order to import bootstrap css to our application, head to `src/index.html` and add: 
```js 
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
```
If your server is running, you will notice the font change in the webpage. 

Create a new folder called `components` inside our `src` folder. We will store all our components in this folder. We create a new file `counter.jsx`. Using `.jsx` instead of `.js` might give better code completion.
